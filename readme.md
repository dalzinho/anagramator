# Anagramator

Some hacky fun to help with the crossword.

It can:
* traverse wikipedia and build a list of subject headings.
* load files from a wordlist
* allow you to match those words according to a p?tt?rn (only missing letters for now)

It's going to want you to provide it some params:

    url: ${anagramatordbhost}
    username: ${anagramatordbusr}
    password: ${anagramatordbpw}
